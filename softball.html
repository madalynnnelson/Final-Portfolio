    <p>I have been playing softball as long as I can remember, this is one of the some things that hasnt changed in my life. I even played high school softball when I was in
    8th grade, I liked it but it wasn't as much fun as I remember so my freshmen year of high school I didn't play.</p>
    <p>I normally played in the infeild and sometimes very rarely I played outfeild. The main bases I was good at were 1st, 3rd and shotstop,
    when I played softball I have been injuried quite a bit. I almost broke my right ankle but never had it looked at so it never got heeled right.</p>
    <p>Softball can be a very compicanted game and someone can get hurt very easly, I remember always having buires all over from getting hit by a softball.
    I'm very forchenit that I actually never broke nothing but I have been hurt very bad before.</p>

<p>The league-wide batting average has generally ranged between .250 and .275, and players with batting averages above .300 are considered to be very good batters.
   A batting average of .400 over a season is considered to be the ultimate achievement by a batter and is nearly unattainable in modern baseball or softball.</p>
