<p>For its first five years 1990-1995, HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a number of extensions. In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of Web forms.
This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a Web technology was limited to entirely new technologies rather than as a replacement for existing deployed technologies like HTML.
In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all, and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG

  <p>CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners Lee at CERN.Style sheets have existed
    in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the Internet.
  Having worked on personalized newspaper presentations at the MIT Media Laboratory, Hakon saw the need for a style sheet language for the Internet.
Style sheets in browsers were not an entirely new idea. The separation of document structure from the document's layout had been a goal of HTML from its inception in 1990.
Tim Berners Lee wrote his next browser/editor in such a way that he could determine the style with a simple style sheet. </p>
