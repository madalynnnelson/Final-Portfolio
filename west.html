    <p> I have been going to Davenport West High School for about a year and a half now. I have made lots of friends and memories here, playing softball and joining the robotics teams.
    My freshmen year I was on The Combustiable Lemons and my sophomore year I'm on the Disruptive Innovation team which is FRC while last year was FTC.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>We have a FRC team called Disruptive Innovation, it is like FTC but this Competition has very big robots instead of little ones. For Disruptive Innovation this year I am one of the communations/outreach lead along with a fellow student that's in the daytime class. We have been making great
    progress and already making a difference, for veterans day we had an aud for our veterans. We had people come and talk about what branch they were in and their own experience in the military.With Disruptive Innovation this year 2019-2020, we didn't have a lot of people left with experience. Last year 2018 we had a lot on seniors, so that means they were leaving at the end of the year.
  </div>
    <p>   With outreach we have been doing LEGO robotics for little kids for about four years now, with FLL Jr. this year the theme is contruction/ building and so far the kids are doing great.The kids are learning a lot and having so
  much fun programming the little robot they have to practice on.Team 6317 has been competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition for 4 seasons, and a total of 8 official events.
  They were a rookie (and began competing) in 2017 and remain active as of the last season, 2019.The students have been competing in St. Louis, Missouri at the FIRST Tech Challenge since Tuesday.
  The robots go through round after round of judging and elimination with the other robots.Disruptive Innovation was awarded the Chairmen’s Award at the Seven Rivers Regional in La Crosse, WI. The Award advances West’s FRC team to the World Championship in Detroit from April 24th to 27th 2018.</p>

    <p> The Combustible Lemons is a FTC team that has went to worlds and won. The Combustible Lemons is FIRST Tech Challenge Team 5466 from Davenport West High School, Davenport, IA. It is made up of 14 students ranging from 9th to 12th grade, and 5 coaches/mentors. Each year the team builds a robot for the annual FTC competition. During the 2011-2012 season, the team was on the winning alliance at the Iowa Championship, won the Inspire Award at the Michigan Championship, and attended the World Championship. This year we are captains of the finalist alliance at the Solon Qualifier and have qualified to go to the Iowa State Championship.
The Combustiable Lemons went to worlds back in 2016 and the Mortal Combots got to State.They're evaluated on things like build, speed, and accuracy. On the last night awards were handed out, a parent of
one of the students tells KWQC that, out of the 250 teams that competed, the Combustible Lemons won the Inspire Award. This particular award recognizes excellence in robot design and teamwork
They're evaluated on things like build, speed, and accuracy. On the last night awards were handed out, a parent of
one of the students tells KWQC that, out of the 250 teams that competed, the Combustible Lemons won the Inspire Award. This particular award recognizes excellence in robot design and teamwork.Greg Smith, one of the team leaders, estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people in the events. He teamed up with instructors who included Brosius and Jason Franzenburg.
One reason for West's success is experience, Franzenburg said, noting the robotics program started in 2011. In addition, the teens involved are in Davenport West's INSPIRE Career Education Academy.The Combustible Lemons earned another State Championship qualification at the Central College qualifier in Pella, IA. The Lemons were finalist for 5 out of 6 possible awards; Think (Engineering Notebook), PTC Design, Connect, Motivate, and Inspire 2nd place. The Lemons won their 2nd Connect Award of the season for the work they are doing to start an FLL team in Ghana. The robot performed well being selected  first by the number 1 seed in qualifying. And this alliance made it to the finals.</p>

<p>Our last team that west high has is the Mortal Combots who in 2019 went to worlds.West’s FTC team, the Mortal Combots, finished 23rd out of 80 in the Ochoa Division at FIRST Robotics World Championships. In the grand scheme of things, we finished in the top 100 out of 6200 (1%) teams in the world.
  West’s FTC team, the Mortal Combots, qualified for the World Championship by winning the FTC INSPIRE award. In 2018, the Mortal Combots sold wreaths for christmas to help spread their name and logo. They put little mini robots on either side of their logo, both the Mortal Combots and The Combustible Lemons help putting flags out in specail days.
We had to get up early in the morning and after dinner go back and pick them up, even if the west teams were agenst each other they would still work and help give back to our Communty.</p>
