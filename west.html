    <p> I have been going to Davenport West High School for about a year and a half now. I have made lots of friends and memories here, playing softball and joining the robotics teams.
    My freshmen year I was on The Combustiable Lemons and my sophomore year I'm on the Disruptive Innovation team which is FRC while last year was FTC.</p>
    <p>For Disruptive Innovation this year I am one of the communations/outreach lead along with a fellow student that's in the daytime class. We have been making great
    progress and already making a difference, for veterans day we had an aud for our veterans. We had people come and talk about what branch they were in and their own experience in the military</p>
    <p>Disruptive Innovation was awarded the Chairmen’s Award at the Seven Rivers Regional in La Crosse, WI. The Award advances West’s FRC team to the World Championship in Detroit from April 24th to 27th 2018.
    The Combustiable Lemons went to worlds back in 2016 and the Mortal Combots got to State.

      <p>With Disruptive Innovation this year 2019-2020, we didn't have a lot of people left with experience. Last year 2018 we had a lot on seniors, so that means they were leaving at the end of the year.
      With outreach we have been doing LEGO robotics for little kids for about four years now, with FLL Jr. this year the theme is contruction/ building and so far the kids are doing great. The kids are learning a lot and having so
    much fun programming the little robot they have to practice on.</p>
